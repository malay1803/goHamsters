Fitness has become an integral part of everyone’s lives. Especially after the pandemic outbreak, the desire to stay fit increased suddenly. And since gyms were shut down, a lot of people turned to home workouts. There were many online fitness subscriptions offering workout programs but they often charged a high amount and also the routines were usually not customised to the user’s requirements.  
Our website offers a one-stop solution wherein free and essential fitness-related information to the users. It is an interactive website which will be fun to use. 

## Components:
### Exercise Directory:
This is a directory of all the exercises the user would need for his/her workouts. Users are first directed to a page where they can select their gender. Then they are directed to a muscle map, from where they select the muscle they want to train. Then, they are directed to a page where the exercises for the selected muscle group are shown. Users are also given the option to select equipment of their choice i.e., stretches, bodyweight, barbell, dumbbells or kettlebells and then see the list of the exercises. If they want to see the details of the exercises, they can click the ‘View Details’ button and see the steps. 

### Calorie Calculator:
It is really important for a person to know about his/her maintenance calories to understand the amount of food required by the body. The maths is simple- if you want to gain weight, eat more than the maintenance calories and if you want to lose weight, eat less than your maintenance calories. 
In this page, a user needs to enter the details like age, weight, height and his daily exercise intensity. The exercise intensity includes options like sedentary lifestyle, active lifestyle, very active lifestyle etc. which makes the calculation much more accurate. The page then calculates the BMR and displays the recommended calories accordingly. 

### Calorie Tracker:
Using this tool, the user can track his/her calories. For this, the user has to sign up. After signing up, the details about the user are captured. The user can then add food items and their quantities. Our tool uses an API which usually has all items of Indian Cuisine and other snacks etc. We display the amount of fats, carbohydrates and protein each item has.  This tool also saves the data for the previous days. The user can go and check his calories consumed over the past week.
